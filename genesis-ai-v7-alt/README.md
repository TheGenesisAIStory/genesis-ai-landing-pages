# Genesis AI v7 – Alt Layout (Apple x AI Startup)

This variant reimagines the Genesis AI landing page with a cleaner "Apple keynote" presentation blended with bold AI gradients.
It keeps the same story pillars (ecosystem, team, consulting, metrics) but reorganizes them into full-bleed sections, glassmorphism cards, and editorial typography.

## Files
- `index.html` – new markup
- `styles.css` – full design system
- `scripts.js` – interactions (navigation toggle, sliders, observers)

## Quick start
```bash
cd genesis-ai-v7-alt
python3 -m http.server 8080
# visit http://localhost:8080
```

You can deploy with GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel the same way as the original version.
